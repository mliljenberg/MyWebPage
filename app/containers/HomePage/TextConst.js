  text: 'My name is Marcus Liljenberg and I am currently completing my Maters degree in Computer Science at Lunds University in Sweden. In addition to my education, I have had the opportunity to work briefly on development projects in China, Sweden, and Italy. Additionally, I spent time studying in the United States and Australia. From my experiences abroad, I have developed a deep appreciation for cross-cultural communication in an increasingly international business landscape, where geographic boundaries are blurred and solutions must be considered from multiple perspectives. Such exposure to cross-cultural environments has led me to understand that there is no optimal solution to a problem and that following too rigid of a structure impedes creativity. As such, I am passionate about cultivating innovative solutions to existing problems as I believe obstacles, rather than stunting innovation, forces us to “think outside the box”. I enjoy implementing novel solutions to complex problems, so if you are seeking someone to enthusiastically tackle challenging issues, I would be happy to join your team! ',

This is done by researching what the costumer or users actually need, not just what they want. Then creating quick prototypes (I usually use Adobe XD for this) and testing the prototypes on the users. Then via an iterative process, keep improving and testing the design of the prototypes until satisfactory results are obtained.  </p>',
